The goal of phyf is to implement a `tibble` subclass useful for statistical modelling on phylogenetic trees. It mainly implements an phylogenetic flow (`pf`) object that is essentially a tibble with one or more phylogenetic flow collection (`pfc`) columns. Phylogenetic flow collection columns are collections of phylogenetic flow paths (`pfp`), which store data on how information flows through a phylogeny from its root node (phylogenies must be rooted to work with `phyf`) to its tips (and its internal nodes). This allows for easy manipulation of the phylogeny and associated data. The objects are used in the package `fibre` for phylogenetic branch regression models, a highly felxible framework for comparative analysis and modelling trait evolution across a phylogeny.

## Installation
